<p>Just in time for the summer, we are proud to announce the release of Betaflight 4.3!</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Make sure you install and use the latest 10.8 version of the <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/tag/10.8.0">Betaflight Configurator</a> before updating your firmware.</p>

<p>To get the best out of the flight performance improvements, please read the <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.3-Tuning-Notes">Tuning Notes</a>.</p>
<p>
  Overall a smoother, more precise flight experience with better prop wash performance 'and' also an easier setup and tuning experience - to release the full potential of Betaflight 4.</p>
<p>
4.3 is a significant evolutionary step thanks to a slew of diligently coded and carefully tested updates representing thousands of hours of work from the voluntary development and test team.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>New PID based tuning sliders</li> 
    <li>Presets</li> 
    <li>The default PID and filter values have less gyro filtering and higher P and D, providing better 'out of the box' performance</li> 
    <li>We've changed how D is configured</li> 
    <li>More accurate loop times</li> 
    <li>Multi dynamic notch</li> 
    <li>The above two changes have significantly improved incoming 'gyro noise'</li> 
    <li>PT3 based RC smoothing</li> 
    <li>RPM crossfading</li> 
    <li>PT2 and PT3 lowpass filtering options</li> 
    <li>Feedforward jitter reduction</li> 
    <li>Other feedforward improvements</li> 
    <li>AntiGravity improvements</li> 
    <li>Dynamic gyro filter expo curve</li> 
    <li>Improved dynamic idle</li> 
    <li>Linear and Dynamic mixer options</li> 
    <li>Feedforward in Level and Horizon Modes</li> 
    <li>Actual Rates is the new Betaflight default</li> 
    <li>CrossfireV3 and Ghost RC link improvements</li> 
    <li>FrSky OSD fix</li> 
    <li>Lua script updates</li> 
    <li>Changed CLI command names - many CLI parameters are re-named.</li> 
    <li>ExpressLRS over SPI Support</li> 
  </ul>
