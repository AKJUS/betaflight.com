<p><b>We're already late, so let's keep this short!</b></p>
<p>As you've come to expect, we've packed this release with a whole lot of new flying goodness, new features, and support for a bunch of new targets.</p>
<p>For an extended list of new features see the <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases/tag/4.1.0">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>To make sure you get the latest version of your target installed, head over to <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases">this page</a> and make sure you have got the latest version of Betaflight configurator installed before updating your firmware.</p>
<p>To get the best out of the flight performance improvements, please read these <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/4.1-Tuning-Notes">tuning tips</a>.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Betaflight, please see the <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases/tag/4.1.0">release notes</a> for a list of things that you might have to change in your configuration.</p>
<p>We have tried to make this release as bug free as possible. If you still find a bug, please report it back to us by opening an issue <a href="https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about Betaflight, ask configuration questions, or just hang out with fellow pilots, you can do this in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/betaflightgroup/">Facebook group</a>.</p>
<p>Betaflight also has a presence in the Slack messaging platform. Register <a href="https://slack.betaflight.com/">here</a>, and then come join us in Slack. Most developers hang out there, so this is a great place to talk about the things you are tinkering with in Betaflight, or get help with really complicated configuration problems.</p>
<p><i>Have fun</i></p>
